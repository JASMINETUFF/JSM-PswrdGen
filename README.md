## Password-Generator

This is my homework assignment to show my understanding of Javascript. 

This webpage consists of HTML, CSS, AND JS CODE.

When the button generate password is clicked you will be asked to choose between 8 and 128. If you do not choose a number inn between you will be notified as an alert that you need to submit a correct input. Once you enter a correct input you will be walked through a series of prompts deciding what your password will consist of....for example: 
- Uppercase
- Lowercase
- Numbers
- Special Charecters. 
Once you have completed the prompt you will have the new password generated in the white box. 

I have also modified the css and html to give it my own personal touch. Thank you!
